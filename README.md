‚úÖ Real-World Problem to Solve
Project Name: "QuickTrack" ‚Äì A Smart Issue Tracker for Small Teams

Problem:
Small businesses, student teams, and freelancers often lack an efficient, simple way to track tasks, bugs, and team activities. Existing solutions like Jira and Trello are too bloated or costly.

Your Solution:
Build a lightweight issue tracking web app with role-based access (Admin, Member), support for task status updates, filtering, and basic analytics.

üöÄ Why This Stands Out
Solves a real and relatable need (even your reviewers might use it).

Demonstrates business thinking: You‚Äôre not just coding‚Äîyou‚Äôre solving a product problem.

Demonstrates a full-stack skill set clearly in one package.

Showcases collaboration-readiness via role management, commenting, and status changes.

You can deploy it, then use it to manage your own projects, showing real-world use.

üîß Key Features to Implement (Demonstrate In-Demand Skills)
Authentication & Authorization (e.g., login, signup, role-based views)

CRUD Operations for tasks and projects (core backend/frontend logic)

Commenting System (showing relational DB knowledge and UX thinking)

Status Filtering & Search (demonstrates API query design)

Analytics Dashboard (task trends, completion rate ‚Äì show async data processing)

Notifications/Email Alerts (optional stretch goal)

Responsive UI with Dark Mode (mobile-first design, accessibility)

üõ† Recommended Tech Stack
Frontend
React (component-driven, scalable)

Tailwind CSS (rapid styling, professional modern UI)

React Router (routing)

Axios (API calls)

Backend
Node.js + Express.js

MongoDB with Mongoose (flexible and fast for this scale)

Optional: Use Prisma + PostgreSQL if you're applying to companies that lean towards SQL-based systems.

Extras
JWT Authentication

Nodemailer or emailjs for email features

Chart.js for dashboard visualizations

Render.com / Vercel / Netlify for deployment

In a Technical Interview
Frame it like this:

"I built QuickTrack because I noticed many lightweight teams need simple issue tracking without the complexity of enterprise tools. I handled user authentication, built RESTful endpoints, and created a responsive React UI. One challenge was filtering tasks by status and date dynamically, which I solved using Express query logic and Mongo aggregation. This project taught me real-world deployment and how to debug production errors quickly."
